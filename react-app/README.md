This is a podcast platform that displays many different shows and allows us to navigate through the seasons in the shows and the episodes in the seasons and play their respective audio.

When we open the application, which we do after locally installing the folder and running npm install if running locally that is, if running from the website then no need to worry about installing any packages. WHen we do open the application we will be met with the very plain home page, from which we can navigate through the rest of the application via the aside navBar and then we can navigate to the library page, through which we can navigate to a show by clicking its image, and then navigating to its season by selecting teh matching select option, which will change the Ui to display a series of episodes from that season that we can then read teh details of, play the audio and favorite the episode if we so please.

There is also the favorites page which stores all the favorite episodes from local storage that we can navigate to through selecting a show, its season and then being displayed cards of the favorite episodes.

On teh favorite page we will also find the clear local storage button to remove all listening history.
